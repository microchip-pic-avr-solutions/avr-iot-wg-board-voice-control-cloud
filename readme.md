# AVR® IoT WG Board with Voice Control - Cloud Script

A python script for a Google Cloud Function to process voice commands from Dialogflow and send them to the AVR-IoT Board. Used in the user guide [*Voice Control with Google Assistant*](http://microchip.com/DS50002969). The embedded C code for the IoT board can be found at [Atmel Start](https://start.atmel.com/#example/Atmel%3AAVR_IoT_WG_Sensor_Node_With_Voice_Control%3A1.0.0%3A%3AApplication%3AAVR_IoT_WG_Sensor_Node_With_Voice_Control%3A).
